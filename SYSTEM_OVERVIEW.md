- **API-ready structure** for integration with external services

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Technologies Used
- **Python 3.7+** with modern async/await patterns
- **aiohttp** for asynchronous HTTP requests
- **BeautifulSoup** for HTML parsing
- **NLTK + scikit-learn** for NLP processing
- **pandas** for data manipulation
- **Selenium/Playwright ready** for JavaScript-heavy sites

### Architecture Patterns
- **Async context managers** for resource management
- **Abstract base classes** for consistent scraper interfaces
- **Data classes** with validation for type safety
- **Factory pattern** for scraper selection
- **Observer pattern** for progress tracking

### Error Handling
