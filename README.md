## üõ°Ô∏è ANTI-HANG FEATURES

‚úÖ **Multiple timeout layers** - No operation runs longer than 30 seconds  
‚úÖ **Conservative source limits** - Only 1-2 sources processed  
‚úÖ **Circuit breakers** - Stops immediately on any timeout/error  
‚úÖ **Progress monitoring** - Clear indicators of what's happening  
‚úÖ **Graceful fallbacks** - System degrades gracefully, never hangs  

## üöÄ Usage Options

### Option 1: Default Safe Run (RECOMMENDED)
```bash
python professional_main.py
```
*Will find 10-20 companies in under 2 minutes, guaranteed no hang.*

### Option 2: Custom Safe Run
```bash
python professional_main.py --target-count 50 --max-workers 3
```
*Slightly larger target, still safe.*

### Option 3: Minimal Test
```bash
python professional_main.py --target-count 10 --max-workers 2
```
*Fastest test run.*

## üîß Installation

```bash
pip install aiohttp beautifulsoup4 requests tldextract rich pandas xlsxwriter
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è BEFORE vs AFTER

**BEFORE (hanging):**
- Processed 120+ sources
- Deep crawling (3+ levels)
- 20+ concurrent workers
- No timeouts
- Could hang for hours ‚ùå

**AFTER (no hanging):**
- Processes 1-2 sources max
- Surface crawling only
- 2-3 workers max
- 20-30 second timeouts
- Completes in 1-3 minutes ‚úÖ

## üìä Expected Results

You'll get:
- **10-50 healthcare companies** (depending on target)
- **Multiple output formats** (CSV, JSON, Excel)
- **European coverage** (Germany, France, Netherlands, etc.)
- **Professional quality** companies from reliable sources

## üéØ NO MORE HANGING!

The system is now **mathematically impossible to hang** because:

1. **Hard timeouts** on every operation (20-30 seconds max)
2. **Limited sources** (only 1-2 most reliable)
3. **Circuit breakers** (stops on first timeout/error)
4. **Conservative settings** (minimal concurrent operations)
