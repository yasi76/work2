# 🏥 Dynamic European Healthcare Database Builder

**🚀 Dynamic Research Pipeline for Healthcare Startups & SMEs**  
*No more hardcoded URLs - Live discovery from trusted sources!*

## 🎯 **What's New - Dynamic Discovery!**

Instead of hardcoded URLs, this project now uses a **dynamic research pipeline** that:
- ✅ **Actually finds companies** from Wikipedia and stock exchanges
- ✅ **Generates URLs automatically** from company names  
- ✅ **Always fresh data** from current sources
- ✅ **Scalable and extensible** research methods
- ✅ **Your manual URLs preserved** and combined with discoveries

---

## 🔄 **Two-Script Dynamic Workflow**

### **🔍 Script 1: Discovery (5-10 minutes)**
```bash
python3 DYNAMIC_RESEARCH_DISCOVERY.py
```
- Scrapes Wikipedia healthcare categories live
- Extracts companies from major European stock exchanges
- Generates potential URLs from company names
- Validates a sample to test methodology
- **Outputs:** URL lists for the validation script

### **🎯 Script 2: Validation (60-90 minutes)**  
```bash
python3 DYNAMIC_MEGA_HEALTHCARE_DATABASE.py
```
- Loads discovered URLs automatically from Script 1
- Combines with your original 52 manual URLs
- Validates all URLs comprehensively
- **Outputs:** Complete database with 200-600+ companies

## 📊 **Latest Results**

### **Dynamic Discovery Results:**
- ✅ **86 companies** found from systematic research
- ✅ **532 potential URLs** generated from company names
- ✅ **13.3% validation success rate** in sampling
- ✅ **Live extraction** from trusted sources

### **Expected Combined Results:**
- 🎯 **Your manual URLs**: 52 companies
- 🎯 **Dynamic discoveries**: 50-100+ additional companies  
- 🎯 **Total database**: 150-300+ companies
- 🎯 **Much more scalable** than hardcoded approaches
