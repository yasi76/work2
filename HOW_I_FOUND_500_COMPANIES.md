    pattern = r'<li><a href="/wiki/([^"]*)" title="([^"]*)"[^>]*>([^<]*)</a>'
    matches = re.findall(pattern, content)
    
    companies = []
    for wiki_slug, title, name in matches:
        # Generate potential website URL
        clean_name = name.lower().replace(' ', '').replace('-', '')
        potential_urls = [
            f"https://www.{clean_name}.com",
            f"https://www.{clean_name}.de",  # For German companies
            f"https://www.{clean_name}.co.uk",  # For UK companies

## 🔗 URL Generation & Validation Strategy

### **How I Generated Website URLs from Company Names:**

```python
def generate_potential_urls(company_name, country_hint=None):
    clean_name = company_name.lower()
    clean_name = re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z0-9]', '', clean_name)  # Remove special chars
    
    potential_urls = [
        f"https://www.{clean_name}.com",
        f"https://{clean_name}.com",
        f"https://www.{clean_name}.eu",
    ]
    
    # Country-specific domains
    if country_hint == 'Germany':
        potential_urls.extend([
            f"https://www.{clean_name}.de",
            f"https://{clean_name}.de"
        ])
    elif country_hint == 'UK':
        potential_urls.extend([
            f"https://www.{clean_name}.co.uk",
            f"https://{clean_name}.co.uk"
        ])
    # ... similar for other countries
