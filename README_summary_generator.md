## Metrics Explained

### Overview Metrics

- **Total URLs Analyzed**: Total number of URLs processed
- **Live Websites**: URLs returning HTTP 200 status
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of URLs that are live
- **Health-Related**: Live sites with health relevance score â‰¥ 3
- **Health Rate**: Percentage of live sites that are health-related

### Health Relevance Score

Scale of 0-10 based on health keyword matches:
- 0-2: Not health-related
- 3-5: Possibly health-related
- 6-8: Likely health-related
- 9-10: Definitely health-related

### Regions

- **DACH**: Germany, Austria, Switzerland
- **Europe**: Other European countries
- **Unknown**: Could not determine region

## Example Console Output

```
==================================================
DIGITAL HEALTH STARTUP ANALYSIS SUMMARY
==================================================
Total URLs analyzed: 500
Live websites: 380 (76.0%)
Health-related: 285 (75.0% of live)
Top regions: DACH, Europe, Unknown
Verified health startups: 285
==================================================

## Use Cases

1. **Investment Research**: Identify verified digital health startups in specific regions
2. **Market Analysis**: Understand the distribution of health tech companies
3. **Data Quality**: Assess the quality of discovered URLs
4. **Keyword Trends**: Identify common themes in digital health

## Tips

1. Run this after `evaluate_health_startups.py` for best results
2. Use `--excel` flag for detailed analysis in spreadsheet format
3. The markdown report is great for sharing with stakeholders
4. Check the error analysis to improve URL discovery methods

## Troubleshooting

### "No module named 'matplotlib'" error
- Install visualization dependencies: `pip install matplotlib seaborn`
- Or use `--no-viz` flag to skip visualizations

### "No module named 'pandas'" error
- Install Excel dependencies: `pip install pandas openpyxl`
- Or omit the `--excel` flag

### Empty verified startups list
- Check that your URLs are being marked as health-related
- Verify that health_relevance_score threshold is appropriate
- Ensure keywords are being matched correctly
