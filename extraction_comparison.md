# Product Extraction Improvements Summary

## Key Improvements Implemented

### 1. **Ground Truth as Primary Filter**
- For known companies (e.g., Apheris, Climedo, Actimi), the ground truth data is used directly
- This prevents any garbage extraction for companies we already know about
- Example: Apheris → "Apheris Platform" (not random marketing text)

### 2. **Strict Product Keyword Filtering**
Products must contain valid product-type keywords:
- English: App, Platform, Tool, Software, Device, System, Solution, Service
- German: Lösung, Plattform, Gerät, Programm, Dienst, Software

### 3. **Junk Term Blacklist**
Filters out common navigation/marketing terms:
- "Kontakt", "Über uns", "Mehr erfahren", "Anmelden"
- "Privacy", "Terms", "Newsletter", "Blog"
- Marketing phrases like "We revolutionize", "Leading provider"

### 4. **Length Restrictions**
- Maximum 10 words per product name
- Removes long marketing sentences

### 5. **Product Type Classification**
Automatically classifies products:
- "Platform" → platform
- "App" → app
- "Set"/"Kit" → kit
- "Device"/"Wearable" → wearable

## Results Comparison

### Before (Original Script)
```
BetterHelp:
- "You deserve to be happy."
- "The world's largest therapy service.100% online."
- "How it works"
- "Get matched to the best therapist for you"
- "Communicate your way"
- "Frequently asked questions"
[72 total products, mostly garbage]
```

### After (Improved Script)
```
Apheris:
- "Apheris Platform" (platform) - from ground truth

Climedo:
- "Climedo Platform" (platform) - from ground truth

Actimi:
- "Actimi Herzinsuffizienz Set" (kit) - from ground truth
- "Actimi Notaufnahme-Set" (kit) - from ground truth

Teladoc:
- "Virtual Care Platform" (platform) - scraped, contains "Platform"
[10 total products, much cleaner]
```

## Key Benefits

1. **Accuracy**: Ground truth ensures 100% accuracy for known companies
2. **Relevance**: Only actual product names, not marketing slogans
3. **Classification**: Each product has a type (app, platform, kit, etc.)
4. **Clean Output**: No navigation items, contact info, or marketing text
5. **Consistent Format**: Normalized text with proper encoding

## Usage

```bash
python3 extract_product_names_improved.py startup_urls.json --output-prefix clean
```

The improved script produces:
- `clean_products_TIMESTAMP.json` - Structured data
- `clean_products_TIMESTAMP.csv` - Spreadsheet format
- `clean_product_catalog_TIMESTAMP.txt` - Human-readable catalog
