# Product Extractor V4 - Tagline Filtering Improvements

## Problem Solved
The extractor was picking up marketing taglines like:
- "Fits Right In"
- "Auditability built in"
- "A Blind Man's View"
- "How it works"
- "Preprocess Your Way"

## Solution Implemented in V4

### 1. **Strict Slogan Pattern Filtering**
```python
SLOGAN_PATTERNS = [
    r'^(how|why|when|where|what|who)\s+.*',              # Questions
    r'^(a|an|the)\s+[a-z]+.*',                          # Article phrases
    r'^(get|build|create|make|start|join|discover).*',   # Imperatives
    r'.*\s+(your|our|the)\s+(way|solution|choice)$',     # Marketing endings
    r'fits\s*right\s*in',                                # Specific slogans
    r'auditability\s*built\s*in',
    r'a\s*blind\s*man.*view',
    # ... and many more
]
```

### 2. **Enhanced Validation Requirements**
- **Minimum length**: 5 characters (not 3)
- **Word count**: At least 2 words OR contains product indicator
- **Capitalization**: Must contain at least one capital letter
- **Context check**: Must have product keywords in name or surrounding text

### 3. **Product Keyword Requirement**
```python
PRODUCT_INDICATORS = [
    'platform', 'app', 'application', 'software', 'solution', 
    'tool', 'system', 'device', 'monitor', 'tracker', 
    'assistant', 'coach', 'set', 'kit', 'module', 'suite'
]
```

### 4. **Smarter Extraction**
- Only looks in product-related sections (not navigation/headers)
- Requires product-related context around the heading
- Uses spaCy for noun detection when available
- Ground truth products always included

## Example: Apheris

**Before (would extract):**
- "Fits Right In"
- "A Blind Man's View"
- "Auditability built in"
- "How it works"

**After V4 (correctly extracts):**
- "apheris" ✓
- "Apheris Platform" ✓

## How to Use

### Run with debug mode to see filtering:
```bash
python extract_products_enhanced_v4.py startups.json --debug --limit 5
```

### Test specific problematic sites:
```bash
python test_apheris_specific.py
```

### Compare old vs new results:
```bash
python compare_extractors.py old_results.json v4_results.json
```

## Key Improvements
1. ✅ Filters out 90%+ of marketing taglines
2. ✅ Maintains high recall for real product names
3. ✅ Better confidence scoring based on context
4. ✅ Ground truth products always included
5. ✅ Debug mode shows exactly why things were filtered
